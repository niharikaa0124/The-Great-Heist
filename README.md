🕹️ My Unity Project – The Great Heist

I’ve successfully completed a 2D grid-based detective chase game in Unity:

🎨 Designed a complete UI/UX: main menu, instructions, countdown, score display, pause/resume, restart, and winning/losing screens

🧱 Built custom Tilemaps for walkable paths, obstacles, and escape lines

🤖 Implemented smart thief AI:

Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find shortest escape path

Minimax Algorithm to make strategic movement based on detective’s position

🔊 Added full audio integration:

Background music that pauses/resumes correctly

Sound effects for button clicks, win/loss events, and countdowns

🌐 Deployed the game as a WebGL build playable in browser
